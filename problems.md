1. First I did not know how to setup virtual environments, so I search for it on the internet. The problem was that my computer did not let me to use
scripts to activate my virtual environment. I found out that in powershell I have the option to give my user allowance.

2. The second problem I came to face was that my python did not recognize my other folders as modules. I was getting the error: No module name views. I need to upload my python version,
since the solutions on the internet did not work.
