The functions in the files in the views folder are all made automatic py pyside2. I used the pysed2 app to create the UI
and then converted to Python code.

I wrote the functions in the folder controllers

This class is the class for the Edit Game window, it contains the logic behind the Edit Game window. 
class EditGameWindow(QWidget, EditGameForm):

These functions let us write into the code
def populate_inputs(self):
def select_file(self):

The following functios check error in the input
 def check_inputs(self):

This function write the input into the database
def edit_game(self):

The functions in the files main_window and new_game work in a similar manner.

Finalyy the function in the file connection.py conecst us with our database.
And in games.py we kae the queries for the database.
